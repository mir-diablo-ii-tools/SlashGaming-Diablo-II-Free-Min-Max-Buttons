# SlashGaming Diablo II Free Min Max Buttons
A backport of the 1.13 minimize button to all previous versions of Diablo II, and the maximize buttons for select versions.

## Features
- Enables the toolbar menu, where the minimize and close buttons can be pressed.
- For select versions, enables the maximize button, which acts similar to the one intoduced in 1.13.
  - This functionality also replicates the "-nofixaspect" command line argument and the "Fix Aspect Ratio" registry entry.

## How to Use
Use a program to inject the DLL file into Game.exe.

## Multiplayer Use
This patch will work in any multiplayer setting, but using this patch in Battle.net will most likely get you banned.
